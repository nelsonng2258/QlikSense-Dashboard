<b>Datasets</b><br>
The main dataset is sourced from Kaggle<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beekiran/sales-data-analysis"><sup>1</sup></a>, supplemented by additional self-generated datasets to demonstrate drill-down and rollup functions on QlikSense. <br>


<b>Data Engineering</b><br>
First, design the star schema for the project. Next, divide the main dataset into fact and dimension tables. Then, enrich the respective dimension tables with the self-generated datasets. Refer to ‘Data Engineering’ for the data engineering work done. <br>

<b>Dashboard Design</b><br>
Perform wireframing for the dashboard to visualize the layout and components on a piece of paper. 

<b>Build QlikSense Dashboard</b><br>
Load the fact and dimension tables into QlikSense, and join them using associative joins to form the data model. Develop the dashboard based on the wireframe as a reference. Conduct data quality checks to ensure accuracy.
